LogControl
===

LogControl is a logging utility focused at fine-grained control of logging levels and identifiability.

## Features

- Each module/component/file can have its own logger, messages prefixed with a specific name.
- Hierarchically organised, so log levels can be set for an entire tree of loggers.
- Configurable driver, for interoperability with other log utilities.
